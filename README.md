# Welcome to TTT in go

This is an experiment to learn some `go-lang`.

Things I'd like to learn/explore:
 * use Ginko for testing
 * work in `vim` and in `Goland`
 * use Gomega for assertions
 * try to write it as a _module_ without needing `$GOPATH`
 * `go build` and `go test` should work

While I appreciate the simplicity that `go-lang` tries to ensue, I do want to force the language to be expressive and legible.
